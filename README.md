# Zod Playground

This project contains a playground for Zod similar to Typescript Playground. It is written with vanilla javascript that we all know and ~~hate~~ love. No frameworks, no build tools, just plain Javascript, Web Components, and some libraries from CDN.

## Development

Since this project doesn't use any build tool or framework, you can just open the HTML file in your browser :)

Each Web Component element name is prefixed with `zp-` to avoid confusion with regular HTML element. The prefix stands for `zod playground`.
